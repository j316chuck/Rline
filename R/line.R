#' @title Reconstruct Graph 
#'
#' @description  
#' This function reconstructs your edge list graph into another condensed edge 
#' list graph which you can run the line algorithm on. 
#' 
#' @details 
#' This is a function which takes a graph represented in edge list form as input. 
#' The edge list should be represented as a dataframe with the edges in the form of u, v, w. 
#' u, v are the vertice names and are turned into StringVectors in Rcpp. w is the 
#' edge weight and is transformed into a numeric vector in Rcpp.
#' This function then calls the original line algorithm written in C++. Too
#' gain a better understanding of what each parameter does please look at the 
#' the line paper in references and the implementation in the github link.
#' This function returns a reconstructed graph as a dataframe in the form u, v, w.
#' This reconstructed graph can be passed into line to run the main line algorithm for 
#' graph embedding.
#'
#' @param df edge list representation of the graph in the form u, v, w. Three columns 
#' are in this dataframe. Each of the columns represent a list of vertices u, list of vertices
#' v, and list of weights w. The edges are directed which means edge u -> v has weight w. 
#' To represent an undirected graph just input edges u, v, w and v, u, w.
#' The first column and second column represent the u and v vertices with 
#' character types. The third column represented the weight of the edges. Each row 
#' represents a weighted edge in the graph.
#' @param max_depth The maximum depth in the Breadth-First-Search of reconstruct. 
#' Default is 1, never input 0.
#' @param max_k For vertex whose degree is less than max_k, reconstruct will expand its neighbors 
#' until the degree reaches max_k. Default is 0.
#' @return a reconstructed graph that can be inputted directly into the line function. 
#' This graph is represented in edge list form in an identical format as the input 
#' parameter df. Note it is also a directed edge list.

#' @title Line Algorithm for Graph Embedding
#'
#' @description  
#' This function runs the line algorithm on your reconstructed edge list graph and returns a  
#' numeric matrix. Each row represents one vertice of the embedded graph with the row name 
#' being the name of the vertice. Each row has a list of weights (all numeric values) 
#' all describing the row vertice.
#'
#' @details 
#' This is a function which takes a graph represented in edge list form as input.  
#' The edge list should be represented as a dataframe with the edges in the form of u, v, w.
#' This dataframe should be generated by the reconstruct function.  
#' u, v are the vertice names and are turned into StringVectors in Rcpp. w is the 
#' edge weight and is transformed into a numeric vector in Rcpp.
#' This function then calls the original line algorithm written in C++. Too
#' gain a better understanding of what each parameter does please look at the 
#' the line paper in references and the implementation in the github link.
#' An important parameter is that you can run this algorithm on multiple threads 
#' to speed up the runtime. The results are not deterministic if you run this algorithm 
#' for more than one thread. Another important parameter is that you can train the line algorithm
#' on two orders, order 1 and order 2 which return different numeric matrices 
#' for the same graph input. There are other parameters which determine the amount of sampling, 
#' negative sampling, learning rate, etc. of the algorithm which you should look into.
#' This function returns a reduced graph represented in the form of a numeric matrix.
#' This numeric matrix has row names describing the vertices with each vertice  
#' This reconstructed graph can be passed into line to run the main line algorithm for 
#' graph embedding
#'
#' @param df edge list representation of the graph in the form u, v, w. Three columns 
#' are in this dataframe. The edges are directed which means edge u -> v has weight w. 
#' To represent an undirected graph just input edges u, v, w and v, u, w.
#' The first column and second column represent the u and v vertices with 
#' character types. The third column represented the weight of the edges. Each row 
#' represents a weighted edge in the graph.
#' @param binary Save the learnt embeddings in binary moded; This should always be 0
#'  because R cannot represent binary formats
#' @param dim Set dimension of vertex embeddings. Default is 5
#' @param order The type of model we want, 1 for first order, 2 for second order. Default
#' is 2
#' @param negative Number of negative samples. Default is 5
#' @param samples Set the number of training samples as k million. Default is 1 (million)
#' @param threads Use how many # of threads. Default is 1
#' @param rho Set the start learning rate. default is 0.025
#' @return a numeric matrix of order 1 or 2. Input two numeric matrixes of different order
#' into concatenate to get a fully represented graph embedding. 
#' This embedded graph has row names as vertices. Each row is a set of weights describing the
#' row name/feature/vertice.

#' @title Concatenate Two Graph Embeddings
#'
#' @description  
#' This function concatenates two graph embeddings represented as numeric matrixes returned by 
#' line
#'
#' @details 
#' This function concatenates two graph embeddings represented as numeric matrixes of different
#' orders. It takes two numeric matrixes returned by line after calling line with the same input
#' dataframe but different orders (1 and 2). It returns a combined graph embedding represented 
#' as a numeric matrix with row names representing the vertice. Each row is a list of
#' weights describing the embedded and concatenated row vertice.
#'
#' @param input_one the first numeric matrix returned by line. This graph should be 
#' generated by a different order parameter than input_two
#' different order than input_two
#' @param input_two the second numeric matrix returned by line. This graph should be
#' generated by a different order parameter than input_one
#' @param binary This should always be zero as we don't want a binary formatted dataframe. default is 0

#' @title Normalize Graph Embedding 
#'
#' @description  
#' This function normalizes each row vector with the formula row = row / || row ||.
#' 
#' @details 
#' This function normalizes each row vector with the formula row = row / || row ||. This website
#' \url{https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-vectors/a/vector-magnitude-normalization} is a good explanation of this normalization.
#' The output has floating point differences with the original line algorithm's normalize function
#' because R has different floating point arithmetic than C++.
#' 
#' @param input_matrix numeric matrix that will be normalized.
